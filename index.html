                This was similar to the former Indian system of education, in which the pupils would learn either in
                their homes or with reputed priests or Gurus. Before Nepal was declared a democratic country, the
                general public had no access to formal education. </p>

                Rana in 1853, was intended for the elite.</p>

                development regions and education offices in each of Nepal's 76 districts to bring educational
                administration to the people. These decentralized offices are responsible for overseeing local informal
                and school-level educational activities. Regional directorates are primarily responsible for
                coordinating, monitoring and evaluating educational activities, and the district education offices

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Nepal's first college was Tri-Chandra College, founded in 1918. Until
                1985, Tribhuvan University was the country's only university. During the early 1980s, the government
                developed the concept of a multi-university system in which each school would have its own nature,
                content, and function.

                The first new university was Mahendra Sanskrit University. It was followed by Kathmandu University (the
                first university, initiated from a private side) in 1990 and Purbanchal and Pokhara Universities in 1995
                and 1996, respectively. </p>
